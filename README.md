# VSXViz

A Flutter desktop application for visualizing VS Code extension data generated by [VSXList](https://github.com/rmaws/vsxlist). VSXViz provides interactive charts, profile management, and extension analysis tools to help developers understand and manage their VS Code configurations.

## Features

### Current Features (v1.0.0)
- ✅ **Cross-platform Desktop App** - Runs on Linux and Windows
- ✅ **Material Design 3 UI** - Modern interface with VS Code blue theming
- ✅ **Navigation Rail Interface** - Clean side navigation between screens
- ✅ **Comprehensive Data Models** - Complete VsCodeExtension and VsCodeProfile classes
- ✅ **Full Test Coverage** - 22 unit tests covering all model functionality
- ✅ **Light/Dark Theme Support** - Follows system theme preferences

### Planned Features
- 📊 **Data Visualization** - Interactive charts and graphs for extension analysis
- 📁 **CSV Integration** - Direct import of VSXList CSV output files
- 🔍 **Profile Comparison** - Side-by-side analysis of different VS Code profiles
- 🎯 **Extension Search & Filtering** - Find and categorize extensions easily
- 📈 **Usage Analytics** - Insights into extension usage patterns
- 💾 **Export Functionality** - Save analysis results and reports

## Architecture

VSXViz is built as a companion tool to VSXList, designed to consume and visualize the CSV data that VSXList extracts from VS Code profiles.

### Data Flow
```
VS Code Profiles → VSXList (.NET CLI) → CSV Files → VSXViz (Flutter) → Visualizations
```

## Requirements

- **Flutter SDK**: 3.35.5 or later
- **Dart SDK**: 3.9.2 or later
- **Platform**: Linux or Windows desktop environment

## Installation

### Prerequisites
1. Install Flutter: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
2. Ensure Flutter desktop support is enabled:
   ```bash
   flutter config --enable-linux-desktop
   flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
   ```

### Clone and Build
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vsxviz.git
cd vsxviz

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run tests to verify setup
flutter test

# Run the application
flutter run -d linux    # For Linux
flutter run -d windows  # For Windows
```

### Build for Distribution
```bash
# Build for Linux
flutter build linux

# Build for Windows
flutter build windows
```

## Usage

### Basic Workflow
1. Use [VSXList](https://github.com/rmaws/vsxlist) to extract VS Code extension data to CSV
2. Launch VSXViz
3. Import CSV files (feature in development)
4. Navigate between Dashboard, Profiles, and Extensions screens
5. Analyze and compare your VS Code configurations

### Integration with VSXList
VSXViz is designed to work seamlessly with VSXList output. The recommended workflow:

```bash
# Extract VS Code data with VSXList
vsxlist --output extensions.csv

# Visualize with VSXViz (planned feature)
# VSXViz will read from Data/ folder symlinked to VSXList output
```

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/models/vscode_extension_test.dart
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Analyze code
flutter analyze

# Format code
flutter format .
```

### Development Server
```bash
# Hot reload development
flutter run -d linux

# Build and run release version
flutter run -d linux --release
```

## Data Models

### VsCodeExtension
Comprehensive model representing a VS Code extension with 13 properties:
- **Identification**: id, displayName, publisher, version
- **Metadata**: description, category, installDate
- **State**: isEnabled, isBuiltIn, profileName
- **Analysis**: Business logic methods for categorization and comparison

### VsCodeProfile
Profile management model with extension collection:
- **Profile Info**: name, path, isDefault
- **Extension Management**: Add, remove, check extensions
- **Analytics**: Count extensions, filter by category, compare profiles

## Technology Stack

- **Flutter 3.35.5** - Cross-platform UI framework
- **Dart 3.9.2** - Programming language
- **Material Design 3** - Modern UI components
- **flutter_lints 6.0.0** - Code quality and style enforcement
- **flutter_test** - Unit testing framework
